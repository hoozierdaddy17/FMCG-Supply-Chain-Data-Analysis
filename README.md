# FMCG-Supply-Chain-Data-Analysis

Conducted analysis within the supply chain domain of 'AtliQ Mart,' an FMCG company which is facing a decline in contract renewals from customers. 'AtliQ Mart' operates in Vadodara, Surat, and Ahmedabad, specializing in Dairy, Food, and Beverages. Stakeholders involved in this analysis include the director and head of the supply chain.

##  Problem Statement


### Background

AtliQ Mart, a thriving FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, is actively operating in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodra. With ambitious growth plans, the company aims to expand its presence to additional metro and tier-1 cities within the next two years.


### Challenge


AtliQ Mart is currently facing an issue where certain key customers have yet to renew their annual contracts due to service-related concerns. It is suspected that there have been instances of untimely or incomplete deliveries of essential products over a sustained period, resulting in subpar customer service. To rectify this situation before expanding to additional cities, the management has tasked the supply chain analytics team with monitoring the 'On Time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis. This proactive approach will enable the company to swiftly address any service issues. The supply chain team has adopted a standard methodology to gauge the service level, encompassing the measurement of the 'On-time delivery (OT) %,' 'In-full delivery (IF) %,' and the overall 'On Time in Full (OTIF) %' against the designated service level targets set for each customer.


## My Task


Assuming I am the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined AtliQ Mart recently, I have been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting.

So now I am excited to take on this challenge and build this dashboard and perform the following task:

- Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
- Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting.
- Generate relevant insights not offered in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

## Final Insights


- OTIF is a 'Hard' metric from customer's point of view, but we are unable to meet the customer's demand both by quantity ordered and timely delivery in all the cities. We are trailing with an average of 36.6% in all cities, which is hampering the reliability of customer.

- VOFR is performing good compared to LIFR in all the cities which means we are unable to deliver all requested products from customers. So, we should be prepared with inventory beforehand. At least in the demand season.

- 'Delay in Delivery' has been a major problem in all cities. We were able to deliver 18% of order before agreed delivery date. But, for so many orders were unable deliver 'On Time'. The delay is seen for 1,2, and 3 days with an average of 1.21 days.

- Vadodara, being our biggest market, has much efficient supply chain compared to other two cities since COCD in Ahmedabad and Surat is very high. We should have serious attention to this particular case.

- Customers who are our biggest client and facing serious issues are follows. Their issues should be resolved first.
    
    - Acclaimed Stores.

    - CoolBlue.

    - Lotus Mart.

    - Vijay Stores.
